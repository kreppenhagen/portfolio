As my senior capstone project I led a team of four fellow students towards the goal of improving the low speed turn radius of our baja car. We accomplished this by designing a differential gearbox mechanism to implement sprag-type clutches into the vehicle's driveline, enabling a 15% reduction in turn radius without sacraficing traction.

### Problem Description
In past years, the vehicle's turn radius had been very poor at low speeds, resulting in many points lost at competition because we could not make tight turns to stay on course. We hypothesized that the poor turn radius at low speed was caused in part by our use of a locked differential (aka "a spool"). This prevents the rear wheels from spinning different speeds, which they must do to avoid slipping during a turn, as the outer wheel must travel a further distance than the inner wheel. With a spool, the outer wheel cannot spin fast enough to roll without slipping, so it drags along the ground, generating a force towards the rear of the vehicle. This force generates a moment on the vehicle pulling it out of the turn, as illustrated in the diagram below.

### Preliminary Testing 
We performed an experiment to test this theory by measuring the forces generated by the rear wheels while turning. The results confirmed our hypothesis, showing that at low speeds, the rear wheels generate a torque pulling the vehicle out of the turn (a negative moment). This negative moment is not prevalent at high speeds because weight transfer to the outer wheels increases their grip, while reducing the grip of the inner wheels. This allows the rear outer wheel to roll without dragging, while forcing the inner wheel to slip. But since the inner wheel has very little grip, the slipping generates very little force pulling the vehicle out of the turn.

### Available Solutions
The solution to this problem commonly used in industry is an open differential. Historically, the team has chosen to use a spool instead of an open differential as it provides much better traction in scenarios where one wheel has significantly more grip than the other. In this scenario an open differential will send all the power to the wheel with less traction, likely causing the vehicle to get stuck. These situations are very common in our competition, so a spool was selected at the cost of the vehicle's turn radius. Other commonly used solutions, such as a lockable differential were not desirable as they were overly complex and required input from the driver, distracting them from the race. We set out to find a solution that would improve the turn radius without significantly reducing traction, requiring driver input, or overly increasing system complexity. 

### Solution Concept
We brainstormed ideas for various solutions, and settled on a sprag-type clutch differential mechanism. This mechanism uses one-way sprag type clutches that allow free rotation in one direction, but lock in the other. The video below displays this functionality; the gear and shaft rotate together only in one direction, but are free to rotate independently in the other direction.

Implementing these sprag-type clutches into the vehicle's driveline allows each rear wheel to freely spin faster than the other, but prevents the wheels from spinning slower than the gearbox output. In this way, during a low speed turn the outer wheel is able to spin faster than the inner wheel, allowing it to roll without slipping. This eliminates the force generated by the outer wheel dragging, drastically reducing the moment pulling the vehicle out of the turn. In the case where one wheel has significantly more grip than the other, a majority of the power is delivered to the wheel with more grip since the wheels cannot spin slower than the gearbox output. No driver input is required as the sprags clutches lock and unlock automatically. 

### Design, Build, and Test 
We designed a gearbox to incorporate these sprag type clutches into the vehicle's driveline. The mechanism was designed with a focus on packaging space to minimize impact on the mating subsystems. It was a challenge to incorporate the sprag clutches into the gearbox as it altered the load path of the forces coming from the driveshafts. Each component went through structural analysis, either by hand calculations or FEA to ensure sufficient strength to withstand all load cases.

We manufactured the gearbox and tested to confirm proper functionality. Proof-of-concept testing was performed and showed the differential gearbox could enable a 15% reduction in the low speed turn radius.
