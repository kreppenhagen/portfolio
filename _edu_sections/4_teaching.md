During my graduate studies, I served as a graduate student instructor (GSI) for two undergraduate mechanical engineering courses: 

*ME 320: Fluid Mechanics I (Fall 2019 Semester)*<br/>
*ME 360: Modeling, Analysis, and Control of Dynamic Systems (Winter 2020 Semester)*

As a GSI my job was to assist the professor in teaching students the course material. My main role was holding office hours twice a week where the students could come for tutoring help. I also wrote the solution keys for weekly homeworks and quizzes, and assisted the professor with grading exams. When the professor was unavailable I would conduct the lectures.
