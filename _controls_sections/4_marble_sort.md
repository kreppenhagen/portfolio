I led a group of three classmates in creating a mechatronic four-bar linkage to autonomously sort marbles based on color using an Arduino. The blue and yellow marbles were to be deposited into the clear bucket, while the white and red marbles were to be thrown into the net. A photosensor was used to detect the color of the marbles and an optical encoder was used to keep track of the position of the mechanism. A PID controller was designed to control the motion of the motor.
