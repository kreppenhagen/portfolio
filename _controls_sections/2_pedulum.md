A group of fellow students and I designed a controller to balance an inverted pendulum, stabilizing an unstable system. The controller has two modes of operation: swing-up and balance. When the pendulum is below horizontal, the swing up controller activates to swing the pendulum into the unstable equilibrium position. When the pendulum is above the horizontal, the balance controller takes over to balance the pendulum in the vertical position. The controller was designed using full state feedback control and tuned to improve disturbance rejection and stability.
