A group of classmates and I designed a lead controller to magnetically levitate a steel marble. The position of the marble was detected using an infared sensing scheme. On one side of the marble a diode emitted infared light, while on the other side of the marble, a photosensor detected the intensity of the infared light reaching the sensor. The higher the marble was, the more light was blocked from reaching the detector, allowing for the position of the ball to be measured. The open loop system is unstable, but by using feedback control, we were able to stabilize the system to keep the marble floating, even when disturbances were applied to the system.
