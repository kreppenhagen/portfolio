I upgraded the hardware and software on a robot used for research in Antarctica (pictured above) to improve its sensing capabilities, enabling more advanced autonomous mobility to be developed. The robot's main computer was replaced with a more powerful unit and several new sensors were added. I programmed the main computer and the peripheral devices to set up communication pathways using several different communication protocols (Modbus, TCP/IP Socket, and RS-232 Serial). The peripheral devices included wheel speed/torque sensors, radar, GPS, radio transmitters/receivers, 3-phase BLDC motor controllers, and data aquisition systems.
