<p style="font-size:30px">Engineering Intern - Summer 2016 </p>

I worked at the Fermi II nuclear power plant as an intern in the materials engineering group. As power plants have such a long lifespan, oftentimes the parts used in the plant go out of production or the companies that supplied the parts go out of business. In case of a part failure, replacement parts need to be readily available to avoid plant downtime. My job was to find suitable replacements for obsolete supplier parts to ensure plant readiness in the event of a failure. 

I also worked with several other interns to develop a training tool designed help new hires get aquainted with the plant's unique software, operations, and facilities, speeding up the learning process.
