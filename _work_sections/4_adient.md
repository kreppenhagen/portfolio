<p style="font-size:30px"> Automotive Seating Mechanical Design Intern - Summer 2018 </p>

During my internship with Adient, I was tasked with redesigning a folding headrest mechanism to increase its strength and rigidity. The original headrest design was not strong enough to meet the requirements of certain automotive OEMs, limiting the potential customers to which this headrest could be sold.

I performed destructive strength testing on the original headrest design using an Instron machine and performed root cause analysis on the failed parts to identify design weaknesses as target areas for my redesign efforts. I brainstormed ways to strengthen the mechanism and modeled the design changes in CAD, then assessed the strength/stiffness of the modified mechanism using FEA. The design changes I proposed increased the load carrying capability beyond the strictest OEM requirements while reducing the cost and weight of the mechanism, meaning the redesigned headrest could be sold to all automotive manufacturers at a competitive cost and weight.

I also performed a tolerance study to determine the maximum acceptable tolerances for each part that would ensure mechanism functionality, to aid in tolerancing the prints using GD&T.
