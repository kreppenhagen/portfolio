<p style="font-size:30px"> Advanced Chassis Architecture Engineer - Current Job </p>

I work in the vehicle architecture group which performs the first step in the product development cycle: coming up with the preliminary vehicle design from a general set of specifications (vehicle size, weight, performance targets, etc.). We ensure that the vehicle targets can be met, and aim to minimize cost and weight while resolving any issues with packaging, assembly, or component strength to achieve an efficient overall system design. We thoroughly document all our design decisions and the reasoning behind them before passing our work along to the next group who works with the component suppliers to finalize the designs and put them into production.

Within my group I am the owner for the rear suspension springs and shocks, designing the components to adhere to all design rules while optimizing for cost, weight, and packaging space.
