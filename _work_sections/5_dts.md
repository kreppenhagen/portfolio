<p style="font-size:30px"> Manufacturing Process Engineering Intern - Summer 2017 </p>

I worked as a manufacturing process engineering intern in a production plant where automotive HVAC units are mass produced. I developed a standardized format for service part work instructions and updated old instructions to meet the new standard. I also conducted studies on scrapped parts to determine the root cause of the failures so the manufacturing processes could be corrected, reducing losses from scrapped parts.
