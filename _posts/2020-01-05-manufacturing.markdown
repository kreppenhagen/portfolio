I developed many hands-on skills as a member of the baja team, as about 90% of the vehicle's parts are manufactured in-house by the team members. With a new vehicle being built from scratch every year, there was a lot of manufacturing to be done. 

As one of the team's main welders I was responsible for welding the vehicle's tubular steel frame as well as many of the suspension links. In addition to welding, I machined parts using both manual and CNC mills and lathes. Other processes I am experienced with include:
