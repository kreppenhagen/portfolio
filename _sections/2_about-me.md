I am a mechanical engineer with a master's degree from the University of Michigan with a
focus on mechatronics. I love to learn and have a passion for developing creative solutions to 
tough problems. My dream is to work on mechatronics for space exploration applications. In my free time I love exploring the outdoors, playing music, and shooting photograpy. Visit the tabs on the left to see my past projects and work experience.
